The gcd is the greatest common divisor.

# intuition

# rigour
The gcd of a and b is the smallest possible integer of the form, au + bv

Let $a,b$ be integers. If $d$ is another integer such that $d|a$ and $d|b$ we say that $d$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$. The max in the set $\left\{ d : d|a$ and $d|b \right\}$

gcd is the largest positive positive, and $a$ and $b$ must be non-zero, since $gcd(0,0)$

Find $gcd(132,84)$.
	- Factor tree? List common divisors? Euclidean algorithm is more economical for larger numbers.
- use the [euclidean_algorithm](euclidean_algorithm___11_06_2022__0902301_67.pd)
	- $132 = 1(84) + 48$
	- $84 = 1(48) + 36$
	- $48 = 36 + 12$
	- $36 = 3(12) + 0$ gcd is $12$ as it is the last proper remainder.

	To work out sets of solutions, it is much easier to divide everthing by a common factor and it must have the same solution (once multiplied back) to make them smaller and more manageable.
