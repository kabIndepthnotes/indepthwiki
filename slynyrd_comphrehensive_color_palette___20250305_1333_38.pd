# slynyrd_comphrehensive_color_palette


1. start with a green (the color is arbitary as we will go around the whole spectrum). You want this to be the most saturated in the whole palette and halfway as bright as the brightest.
2. we want 9 colors in a swatch, so go up four, bring the brightness up by 133 and saturation down to about 15%
3. Go down 4 colors, and bring the brightness down by 133 and the saturation to about 20%
4. spread to the middle from both sides
5. make harmonious swatches by copying and pasting, then moving all down in hue by 32
6. repeat step 5 until you go around the whole wheel.
7. copy all the swatches to make a desat version, which is bringing the saturation down by 178pt
