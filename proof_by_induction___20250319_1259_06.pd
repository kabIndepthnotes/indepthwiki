# proof_by_induction


# 1. prove $P(1)$ is true.

# 2. prove "if $P(1), P(2),\ldots, P(n)$ are true, then $P(n+1)$ is true". This must be true $\forall n$
This must be true $\forall n$, and this check is not part of the assumption

This can be considered an algorithmic proof procedure.

- The positive integers themselves are defined by induction, you have the number $1$, and the other numbers are defined from $n+1$
