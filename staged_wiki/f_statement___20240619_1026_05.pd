#  f_statement, syntax
This is involved with the lookup table
The syntax is `f number loadtime table-size GEN-Routine p1 ... pn ; comment`

for example a 16 point sinewave is


f  number  loadtime  tsize  gen  ps
f  111     16        10     1    ;   A  Sine  wave


This get takes 16 equidistant points on a sine wave and by doing so it makes a discrete sine wave.

#  dummy f
This allows you to insert silence into the composition
