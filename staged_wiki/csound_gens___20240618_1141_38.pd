#  csound_gens
These are mathematical programs used to compute a wavetable.

#  GEN5, GEN7, GEN9, GEN10, GEN20
GEN1 uses a prerecorded soundfile that the user can give.
GEN5, GEN7 use exponential curves or straight lines
GEN9, GEN10 use weighted sums of sine waves
GEN20 uses standard window functions, like hamming window.
GEN21 computes tables with probability density functions
