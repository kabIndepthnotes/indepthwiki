How many positive divisors of 15435 are multiples of $21$?
    - $15435 = 5(3087)$
    -       = $5\cdot 3^2 \cdot 7^{3}$
    - Lemma 2.4 means that d is going to have the same prime divisors, but less or equal powers.
Solve $52X \equiv 10$ mod 93
We know that 52 is coprime to 93. Find the inverse with the bezouts lemma and you find the inverse, pre multiply. Or a quicker solution, if the gcd divides the number on the right, then you can just multiply to find the right answer.

Let $d = gcd(a,m) , a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$. Then $$
ax \equiv b \text{ mod m }
$$ 
proof that there is a solution in $\mathbb{Z}$ $\iff d|6$
