##  What is Mascheke's theorem? Can you outline the proof? supppose $G$ is a finite group, and $V$ is a finite-dimensional (really just needs to be compact) representation of $G \to \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. then
every invariant subspace $W$ of $V$ has an invariant complement $W'$.

#  proof
suppose $\exists$ an invariant Hermitian product on $V$.
Then Mascke's theorem follows from lemma $4.10$ and we take $W^{\perp}$.
We need to find an invariant Hermitian product on $V$.
We do this by averaging.
Start with any Hermitian product on $V$, $\left< , \right>$ and take $\left< u, v \right>_{new} = \frac{1}{\left| G \right| } \sum _{g\in G}\left< g\cdot v , g\cdot w \right>$.
We claim that this is a Hermitian product that is invariant under $G$
