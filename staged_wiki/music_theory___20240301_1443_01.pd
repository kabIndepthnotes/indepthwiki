# - Types of chord:
    - Major,
    - Minor
    - Diminished *
    - Augmented *
* these are linking chords for major and minors.

chords and notes and rhythms and melodies.

#  notes
Higher vibrations are higher pitch and vice versa.
There are 12 notes.
There are mathematical equations as to why these notes work.
An octave higher is twice as fast.

##  Keys ==
Keys are notes that work together.
There are 7 notes in major and minor keys.
Key is like the home set, but scale is the notes that are played e.g. for solos.
Blues is written in E major.
Blues solos E blues scale of E pentatonic minor scale.

##  Major Keys ==
use the [[circle_of_fifths___20240322_103317|circle_of_fifths]] to remember major and relative minor chords.

Whole Whole half Whole Whole Whole half
Each note can be said as a degree, the first note is 1st degree and last is 7th degree.

You should know the letter of the note as well as the degree it is in the scale.

#  Chords
Any combination of notes in a scale make a chord.
The following is a triad.
Play a note in the scale, skip a note and play a note, skip a note and play a note.
Root, 3rd, 5th.
Major triads, play root, then the 4th note after and then the 3rd note after.

A major chord is root, 4 semitones and 3 semitones.
A minor chord is root, 3 semitones and 4 semitones.
The relative Minor of a major scale, you move your hand 3 semitones down and play the same notes but starting on that note.
root 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2

0 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 1

#  minor keys
You can construct minor scales, from major scales.
If you take the c major scale, move it three semitones down and play the c major scale but starting at a, you get the a natural minor scale.

#  Number system
The triads in a scale are.
Major Minor Minor Major Major Minor.
Which are.
I i ii IV V vi.
I V vi IV can work well in keys.

The number system helps you play the progression in any key.

##  Practice
Practice making chord progressions in different keys.

#  Inversions
You can move the chords notes to other places.
CEG -> EGC
This can allow small movements in notes to create something more put together.

Inversions can change the flavour of a chord.

##  Practice

#  Melody
This is what you want to sing along to.
You want to use notes that are in the chord progression but also in the scale.
Tension:= Notes that are not in the chord
Stability:= Notes that are in the chord
You want to end on a Stable note.

You can remove the 4th and 7th degree to have a more stable set of melody notes.

#  Rhythm
This is the timing of music.
There is usually 4 beats to a measure.
Whole notes are 4 beats.
quarter notes are 1 beat.
1 2 3 4
To describe half notes you say
1 & 2 & 3 & 4
To describe 16th notes you say
1 e & a 2 e & a 3 e & a 4

#  Bass clef: lines and spaces of sheet music
All Cows Eat Grass describe the notes in spaces.
Great Britain Doesn't Fight America.

#  Beaming, where can it be used
This is the part of a note that are connected by a beam.
Only notes with tails can be beamed, not quarter notes but eigths etc.
They are used to see the main beats of a bar.

#  Dynamics
fff+ even louder but not usually seen
fff:= Fortississimo
ff:= fortissimo
f:= forte loud
mf:= mezzo-forte, half loud
mp:= mezzo-piano, half quiet.
p:= piano, quiet
pp:= pianissimo, even quieter
ppp:= pianississimo, very quiet
crescendo:= gradually get louder.
decrescendo/diminuendo:= gradually get quieter.

fp:= forte immediately dropping to piano
sf:= sforzato, sfz:= sforzando - give a push on a note as you play it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE0RbPsC9uE
sfp:= sforzando piano - force a note and then immediately to piano.
Applies to every note after the notation, regardless of line or bar.
