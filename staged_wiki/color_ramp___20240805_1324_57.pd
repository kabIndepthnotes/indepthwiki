#  color_ramp
ramp:= a ramp is a transition from one color to another.
straight ramp:= Only lightness changes, like a monochromatic palette with no hue shifting. Rarely used.
luminosity ramp:= Sorting by luminosity, there is a formula but it is intuitively the percieved color brightness, not just the "value" component in hsv

static ramp:= Only saturation changes.

##  hue method
Start at end points and transition around the color wheel
Or start with colors you know you want in the piece and expand from there.

#  luminousity method
You go down in luminosity rather than hue.

#  what is the color of the light source method
This is where the lighter the colours get, the closer to the color of the light source they get.
