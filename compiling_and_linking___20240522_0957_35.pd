# preprocessor
In C, the preprocessor is like an editor, it processes commands beginning with `#` and modifies the source code.
see [preprocessor](preprocessor___20241010_1619_29.pd) for details.



# compiler
After preprocessing, the compiler translates the code to object code.
It has references to computer objects that may be defined elsewhere, this needs to be linked by the linker.

# linker
The combines the object code from the compiler to additional code such as library functions.
