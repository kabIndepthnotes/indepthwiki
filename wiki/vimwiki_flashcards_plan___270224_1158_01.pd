upon recollection, print all lines.
Add 1 to the number of times reviewed.
If the card is easy, add 1 to the ease.
If the card is hard, minus 1 to the ease.


- have an option for how many cards you want to study instead of ease formula

Have the option to review special cards such as cards:
	- with high review but low ease (review/ease number)
	- with review 0 (unreviewed cards)
	- with specific tags in them (math, game dev, music, art)
