# difference_between_pointers_and_arrays

- array parameters are interchangable with pointer parameters, but array variables aren't the same as [pointer](pointer___20240830_1618_20.pd) variables

- the name of an array is strictly not a pointer variable, it is just treated as such.
- The compiler converts it to a a pointer when necessary
- To test, see that `sizeof(a)` is different to `sizeof(p)` see page 272 of [c_programming_a_modern_approach](c_programming_a_modern_approach___20250305_1200_46.pd)
