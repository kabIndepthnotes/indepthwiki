#  rating
00 easy, takes a moment to do
10 small recall, takes a minute
20 average application problem, 15-20 minutes
30 moderate difficulty, can take 2 hours
40 hard, is a term project level
50 maybe impossible, A research problem at the time, write up answer for publication.

This scale is logarithmic

M `:=` Math required

HM `:=` Higher math required

M, and HM do not imply difficulty

$\nabla$ `:=` Recommended :~ MUST DO

Note that non-$\nabla \neq$ ~ Don't bother.

You should work the questions for the length of time recommended at least before you check the solutions.
But if it is reasonable to check the solutions in interest of time or utility, then do check the solutions.
You should be able to answer that problem clearly and closely related problems.
