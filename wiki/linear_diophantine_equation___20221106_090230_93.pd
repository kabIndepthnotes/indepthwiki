Diophantine equations :~ Polynomial equations with integer coefficients, we seek integer solutions, $ax + by = c$
## intuition
Let $a,b,c$ be integers, with $a$ and $b$ not both $0$, and let $d=gcd(a,b)$. The equation $ax+by=$... :todo:
Now finding all solutions has a link to a line, specifically the rise over run, is the adding of x and take away of y :todo:
## rigour
## exam clinic
Fnd all integer solutions (or explain why there are no integer solutions)  to the equation $$
52x + 93y = 7
$$
    - Steps, find gcd(52,93)
    - If $gcd|7$
    - Use the [[Bezouts_lemma]] and multiply the equation by 7.
