# metric
## introduction
%%visits: 4
The metric is a abstraction of a distant function using only sets. 
## intuition
Positivity:~ needs to be 0 if and only if equal arguments of the function. Needs to be positive.
Symmetry:~ $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$
Shortest distance :~ [[triangle_inequality]]

We can say two metric_space s are equivalent if any sequences tend to the same number.

## examples and non-examples
The Euclidean metric, which will be referred to as the usual metric. 
The discrete metric, which is one of the best tests for intuition.
