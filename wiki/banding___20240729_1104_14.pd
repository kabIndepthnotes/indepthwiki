#  banding
"When neighbor pixels end at the same x or y coordinate [e.g. a line] on the underlying grid, the grid immediately becomes more evident, the pixels are exposed and the apparent resolution becomes less fine"

This is the most important pitfall to avoid in pixelart

staircase banding:= often seen in [[anti_aliasing___20240704_092417|anti_aliasing]] attempts, this is when
skip one banding:= TODO

When the art is viewed from afar the effects of banding become much more apparent. Also, this means that lower resolution art doesn't have to worry about banding as much.

When a 50/50 line is banded or [[anti_aliasing___20240704_092417|anti_aliased]] on both sides, you have a + . and that plus has 2 fights, the top and bottom cannot live together and the left and right cannot live together, so you have 2 options to kill the top or bottom pixels, or 2 options to kill the left and right pixels.
