# kernel
## introduction
%%visits: 2
Kernel of a linear transformation:= What vectors in the domain map to the zero vector according to the transformation, $$\{v: Av =0 \}$$


$\{ g \in G : \phi(g) = e_g \}$

I feel like this is a general definition of kernels (it is)
## intuition
Kernel of homomorphisms:~ anything from the range that gets mapped to the identity
## rigour
Kernel of [[homomorphism]]s:= ker $phi = \{g \in G_1 | \phi(g) = e_{G_2}\}$ (where $\phi : G_1 \to G_2$ 

This kernel is a normal_subgroup, and there is a 121 relation between normal_subgroups and kernels
