# getchar
"Be careful if you mix getchar and [[scanf___20240531_091544|scanf]] in the same program, scanf has a tendency to leave behind characters that it has "peeked" at but not read, including the new-line character. Consider what happens if we try and read a number first, then a character"

	printf("Enter an integer: ");
	scanf("%f", &i);
	printf("Enter a command: ");
	command = getchar();


"The call of scanf will leave behind any characters that weren't consumed during the reading of `i`, including (but not limited to) the new-line character, `getchar` will fetch the first leftover character, which wasn't what we had in mind."

	while ( (ch = getchar()) == ' ') /* skips blanks */
