# triangle_inequality
## introduction
%%visits: 2
Triangle inequality destroys oscillation.
Triangle inequality:~ the magnitude of the sum is less than or equal to the sum of the magnitudes.
## intuition
For vectors The only time they are equal, is when they form [[orthogonal]] [[vector]]s. 
## rigour
$\left| a + b \right| \le \left| a \right| + \left| b \right|$
## exam clinic
It is a useful procedure for [[convergence]] or [[continuity]], as when finding a value of delta for a value of epsilon, we need stuff to be less than without any variance that overly complicates things.
