## Uniform continuity
Uniform continuity cannot depend on $x$, the order is different. Continuity depends on points, but in uniform_continuity the point has less power to due things, therefore x is chosen after a width is made (delta) and a height.

$\forall \epsilon > 0 \exists \delta_e >0$

Non examples of uniform_continuity (but continuity)

$f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ on (0,1)

In uniform_continuity, the graph cannot keep getting steeper.

uniform_continuity that escapes to vertical infinity, or escape at a boundary.

uniform_continuity:~ When the delta is not dependant on $x$

# uniform_continuity
## introduction
## intuition
## rigour
## exam clinic
## examples and non-examples
example sinx 

non-example $\frac{1}{x}$

The asymptote at $x=0$ is what makes the function $y=\frac{1}{x}$ not be uniformly continuous
