:todo: Alternating groups are sort of symmetric, loosely speaking

## Permuation group notation to cycle notation
:todo:

## Transpositions
transpositions are just 2-cycles, and every cycle can be described as a 2-cycle. A great way to think of this is that you swap things together.

The figure above shows how to write $\begin{pmatrix} 1 &2&3&4 \\ 2&3&4&1 \end{pmatrix}$ in cycle-notation, which would be $(1\ 2)(4\ 2)(2\ 3)$, just jot down which positions to swap, the order does not really matter. Now, an important point, *We could change the order of the swaps and the notation looks completely different, but this represents the same permutation map*, so think [[function]]s.

## Alternating groups
What are alternating groups? Alternating groups are the set of all even permutations (that can be written as even 2-cycles)
