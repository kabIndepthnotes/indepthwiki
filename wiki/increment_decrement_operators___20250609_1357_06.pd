# increment_decrement_operators

# increment and decrement operators, prefix and postfix
`++i`:~ increment i immediately
`i++`:~ use the old value of `i` for now and increment later (not specified in the standard but safe to say after the next statement)

~~~{.c .numberLines}
i = 1
printf("i is %d\n",++i); /* prints "i is 2" */
printf("i is %d\n",i); /* prints "i is 2" */
~~~

and

~~~{.c .numberLines}
i = 1
printf("i is %d\n",i++); /* prints "i is 1" */
printf("i is %d\n",i); /* prints "i is 2" */
~~~

decrement is similar.

postfix `++` and `--` have higher precedence than unary plus/minus
