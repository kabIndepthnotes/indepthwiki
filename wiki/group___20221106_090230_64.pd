# introduction
:introduction_to_abstract_algebra: is about finding a more rigorous way to understand maths. The word abstract means to condense something to a small modular level, so that you have the freedom to pick and chose what you want to do with the abstract module. One such abstract module, is the group.

In the book, How to study for a maths degree, the book describes mathematical objects, which if I recall correctly are informally defined to think of something as it's own entity that you can apply to many things, and not just in math.

Groups have a lot of geometric uses, as well as a lot of uses in algebra. The reason for its appeal is that it can reduce complicated mathematical ideas into a lot more manageable form. There are a lot of uses in [[platonic_solid]]s, and t

There is a matrix form of symmetry groups.

# intuition
In [[set_theory]], if you only had elements and not anything you could do with the elements, then that would be pretty pointless. For example, the notion of adding and taking away is not really understood well or mathematically rigorous without the idea of groups. It is basically a set that can interact with each other, and has a set of rules to make that interaction plausible. For example, there should be a "trivial" element, that is to say, an element that when applied to other elements does nothing, and "does nothing" in mathematical terms is the binary_operation [[function|maps]] the two elements to the non-trivial one.

$dim(G\setminu H) = dim(G) - dim(H)$

# rigour
Grou `:=` Set $G$, with a binary operation. $G\times G \to G$ satisfying
    1. Identity $\exists  e \in G : \forall \ a \in G, ea = ae = a$
    2. Inverses $\forall a \in G\ \exists  b \in G : ab = e = ba$
    3. Associativity $\forall  a,b,c \in G, (ab)c = a(bc)$
    4. Closur `:=` $S\times S \to S$
It must be Associative, have inverses, have the identity, and have closure

Grou `:=` A group is a set $G$ and a mapping from the Cartesian product $G \times G$ into $G$ (a law of composition or a multiplication  law) which we denote by juxtaposition (which means we put it together to show multiplication

Subgrou `:=` H is a subgroups of G iff H is a group with operation $*_G$ and H is a subset of G

All groups of even order contain at least one non-identity element which squares to the identity. e.g. $\mathbb{Z}_2 = \left\{ e,a \right\}$ 


## subgroup
Informally speaking, generators of a group are like the "DNA" of a group, that is to say, they can "replicate" and make all the other elements, they contain the instructions on how to build the whole group.

## Cyclic Groups
$\left< \right>$ stand for span. In a similar idea to a vector.
Cyclic groups are abelian. Since $n,m \in \mathbb{Z}\quad g^{n}g^{m} = g^{n+m} = g^{m+n} = g^{m}g^{m}$

## Theorems
Consider this conjecture for $Z_{p}$. If p is prime then $\mathbb{Z}_{p} = \left< n \right>$ for any $n \in \left\{ 1,2,3 \ldots p-1 \right\}$ Proof: Let $n \in \{1,2,3\ldots,p-1\}$. Now, suppose for contradiction sake, that n does not generate $\mathbb{Z}_p$, then $n$ must have an order less than $p$. This is tautological to $[n^{k}] = [0], k < p$. This implies $kn$ is a multiple of p. But if $k$ has to be less than $p$, then it must be $1$ as those are the only two divisors of a prime. Then $n$ must be be by the same logic. But this is a contradiction as we have explicitly defined $n \in \{1,2,3,\ldots , p-1\}$ So our initial assumption, that $n$ does not generate $\mathbb{Z}_P$ is false.

Any subgroup of a cyclic group is also cyclic. lagranges theorem

Roots of unity in the complex plane.
    - $G = \left\{ e^{i \left( \frac{2\pi}{n}k \right) } | k \in \left\{ 0,1,2, \ldots n-1 \right\}  \right\}$, the roots of unity is a cyclic group, that is isomorphic to the $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$

Let $G$  be a cyclic group generated by  $g_0$. then 
    - $g_0^{n}, n=0,1,2, \ldots , \left| G \right| -1$ are distinct
        -Proof by contradiction. Suppose that they is a repeat.
        - Suppose $\exists n_1,n_2$ with $0\le n_2 < n_1 \le |G| -1$ and that $g_0^{n_1} = g_0^{n_2}$
        - $\implies g_0^{n_1-n_2}$ = e
        - let $q = n_1-n_2$ and note that $q >0$ and  $q > |G|$
        - consider any $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ then $n = kq +r$
        -  $g_0^{n} = g_0^{kq+r} = g_0^{kq}g_0^{r} = g_0^{r} = g_0^{r}$
        - Hence if $g_0^{n} = g_0^{r}$ then $\left< g_0 \right>$ does not generate $G$ :todo: see the lecture video to finish
    - $g^{|G|} = e \forall g \in G$ 
        - by part a $g^{|G|}$ (it has to be distinct)
        - $g^{|G| - m} = e$
        - Now note that if $0<m<|G|$ then the statement contradicts part a of the proof. which leaves only $m=0$
        

# examples
$\left< e , a ,b | ea =a, eb = be=b, e^2 = e = a^2, b^2 = e , aba=bab \right>$ is another generator notion of some group isomorphic to $D_3$
## examples of Cyclic groups
    - $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ (addition modulo p). $\mathbb{Z}_1 = \left\{ 0 \right\} = \left< 0 \right>$ are generated by $\left<1\right>$, intuitively 
    - $\mathbb{Z}_2 = \left\{ 0,1 \right\} = \left< 1 \right>$
        - $2^{0}$ is like saying add 2 to itself, 0 times.
    - $\mathbb{Z}_3 = \left\{ 0,1,2 \right\} = \left< 1 \right> = \left< 2 \right>$ 
    - $\mathbb{Z}_4 = \left\{ 0,1,2,3 \right\} = \left< 1 \right> = \left< 3 \right>$
    - Any factor of $p$ will need to be considered differently.

## =Prove Closure, identity, inverses, then associativity.

To prove that x is a group. The first thing to check is closure. Finding identity helps to find inverses. With associativity, it helps to make $a(bc)c^{-1} = (ab)$ since that implies $a(bc) = (ab)c$. 

*you can assume that [[matrix]] multiplication is Associative*
1. [[matrix]] Matrices with determinant equal to 1 under matrix multiplication, for example 2x2 matrices

*Closure* let $A,B$ be two  $2\times 2$ matrices of unit determinant, i.e. $A,B \in G$.
Then $AB \in G$. Then $AB$ is a  $2\times 2$ matrix and $\det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B) = 1$ 
Therefore $AB \in G$
*Associativity* we must check if  $(AB)C = A(BC)$ where  $A,B,C \in G$. In components  $(AB)C$ as 

$(AB)C = \sum _{k=1}^{2} \sum _{j=1}^{2} \left( A_{ik}B_{jk} \right) C_{kl}$ 

(Now note that the $A_{ik}$ term has an no k position, so it is independent to the summation cycling through k, so we can factor it out as a sort of constant, which is really helpful for proving that this is equal to $A(BC)$)

$= \sum _{j=1}^{2} A_{ij} \left( \sum _{k=1}^{2} B_{jk}C_{kl} \right)$ 

*Identity* $\mathbb{1} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \in G$ as $\det( \mathbb{1}) = 1$

*inverses* All matrices of form $\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \in G$ have inverses $\begin{pmatrix} d & -b & -c & a \end{pmatrix}$ and since $ad - bc =1$ the determinant is also 1. Inverses are in G.

2. If p is prime, then $\mathbb{Z}_p = \left<n \right>$ for any $n \in \left\{ 1,2,3, \ldots , p-1 \right\}$ (Using little fermat's theorem to show how many elements there are in the group, as well as the fact that n cannot share common divisors, means that $n^n = e$ and $\left< n \right>$ has p elements
]
3. Proof that $e$ is unique
Assume  $e_1,e_2$ are distinct identity,
Then $e_1e_2 = e_1$ by 1. $e_1e_2=e_2$ 

4. Proof that the inverse is unique.
For contradiction sake suppose.
So, $\exists a,b,b' : ab' = ab = ba = b'a = e, b \neq a$
So, $bab' = bab$
So, $b' = b$ which is our contradiction


:todo: 
Are permutation groups, primative groups? that is to say most groups are usually perm groups, and all properties of groups are perm groups
I can see what $S_{3}$ looks like, but what does the superset $Perm(X)$ look like?
Symmetric grou `:=` The set of all permutations of n elements is called the symmetric group. $Perm(X) \subset Sym(X)$
$\left| S_{N} \right| =n!$
$S_3$ can be thought of as some sort of action on the three points of a triangle, but this may not extend to $S_4$

:todo:
$\frac{n!}{\Pi j^{n_{j}}n_{j}!}$ is the number of
$n = \sum jn_{j}$
 $\left| A_{n} \right| = \frac{n!}{2}$
 
 
Proving isomorphism:
    - Map generator to generator
    - compare elements
    - compare generators

When dealing with subsets to prove it is a subgroup, we do not need to check associativity as it is inherited
