# voltage_divider_law
$$V_{\mathrm {out} }={\frac {Z_{2}}{Z_{1}+Z_{2}}}\cdot V_{\mathrm {in} }$$

It is used to find out what the voltage should be in a circuit.

# proof
$$V_{\mathrm {in} }=I\cdot (Z_{1}+Z_{2})
  V_{\mathrm {out} }=I\cdot Z_{2}
  I={\frac {V_{\mathrm {in} }}{Z_{1}+Z_{2}}}
  V_{\mathrm {out} }=V_{\mathrm {in} }\cdot {\frac {Z_{2}}{Z_{1}+Z_{2}}}$$

# usage
Sometimes you need to set an analog voltage reference with a specific value, the voltage divider rule will help you achieve this target with ease.
And it will also help you understand how potentiometers work as well.
