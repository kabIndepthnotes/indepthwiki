# semi_direct_product
## introduction
%%visits: 2
The semi_direct_product is used to decompose large groups into smaller groups, and hopefully find the [[normal_subgroup]]s of the groups too, to really understand what is going on with these objects and therefore learning more about operations, elements and different interactions between two numbers.

The motivation for the semi_direct_product is to give only 1 normal subgroup

## intuition
There are different notation to the semi_direct_product. $\ltimes = \triangleright + \times$

And $J = G \ltimes H$ is called an extension of $H$ by $G$
## rigour
The semi_direct_produc `:=` The set $H\times G$ with the group operation. $(g_1,h_1)(g_2,h_2) = (g_1g_2,g_1\phi_{g_1}(h_2)$
