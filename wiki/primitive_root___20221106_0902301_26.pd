# primitive_root
## introduction
%%visits: 2
An element in mod $mod m$ that has the same order as $\left| Z_{m}^{\times} \right|$. They have special properties like generating the group etc.
## intuition

Proof of lemma 4.10.

Let $p$ be a prime. For $d|p-1$ let $W_d = \{[a]_p \in  \mathbb{Z}_p ^{x} : o([a]_p) = d\}$ Then $|W_d| \le \phi(d)$

Proof

Facts (proof of fact is non-examinable) Theorem 3.8
1. Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial such as $f(x) = a_n x^{n} + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} +a_{n-2} x^{n-2} + \ldots + + a_1x + a_0$, then $f(x) \cong 0$ mod p. has at most $n = deg(f)$ solutions in $\mathbb{Z}_p$

2. Let $G$ be a finite group and $g \in G$ s.t $o(g) = d$ then $j \in \mathbb{N}, o(g^{j}) = \frac{d}{gcd(j,d)}$ 

If $W_d = \{\} $ then $0= |W_d| < \phi(d)$

Let $[a]_p \in W_d$. Observe, that since $o([a]_p) = d$, then $a, a^2,a^3 \ldots a^{d}$ are distinct (mod p). Consider, $f(x) = x^{d} - 1$ For each $j=1,2,\ldots,d$, $f(a^{j}) = (a^{d})^{j} - 1 \equiv 1-1 \equiv 0$ mod p. By fact 1, $f(x)$ has at most d roots mod p.

Suppose $[b]_p \in W_d$ then $f(b) = 0$ Hence $[b]_p = [a]_p^{j}$ for some $j=1,\ldots,d$ , where $d = o([b]_p) = o([a]_p^{j}) = \frac{d}{gcd(j,d}$ (by fact 2)

then $gcd(j,d) = 1$ Hence, $[b]_p = [a]_p^{j}$ and $1\le j\le d$ , $gcd(j,d) = 1$ And $|\{1\le j\le d  : gcd(j,d) = 1\} = \phi(d)$ hence proved.

Theorem 4.11

Not every element generates $\mathbb{Z}_{p}^{\times}$, for example, $\mathbb{Z}_{5}^{\times}$ is something is generated by $2$ but then it is impossible by $4$ also. Note in 4.11, that it is generated by $\phi(p-1)$ elements, which is never the order of the group.

## rigour
primitive root:= Let $m$ be a positive integer. If $a$ is an integer co-prime to $m$ such that the order of $a$ modulo $m$ equals $\phi(m)$ (i.e. $o([a]_m) = \phi(m)$, we say that $a$ is a primitive root modulo $m$ (The order is the $\phi$ function)
## exam clinic
When trying to find roots, the primitive_root_test, and a calculator are very handy. But when using a calculator, be careful of rounding errors. Take a look at this question from the keats page.

Trying $27^{8}$ in the calculator (Casio fx-83GT Plus) gives $2.824295365 \times 10^{11}$, now the usual take away by 1 and divide by 31 gives 9110630209, so you may think this is the order, but by the primitive_root_test/ Lagranges_theorem this is impossible. But doing this in python, which has more access to memory, aka it can store more numbers gives.
