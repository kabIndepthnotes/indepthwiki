# indepthwiki_coding_conventions

- the zetel should be akin to a cheatsheet rather than a entertaining blog post. It is a place for me to store quickly accessible notes and should be the same for you.
- files should contain `[a-z_0-9]`, meaning only lowercase english letters, underscores and decimal digits.
- all files should be singular, for example coding_convention rather than coding_conventions as to allow you to write. This is a (coding_convention) and theese are (coding_convention)s, for most but not all cases.

- files should not be longer than 80 lines
- I adopt mathematical notation which I use mainly informally (as a way to illustrate a loosely-defined point rather than to mainly incorporate mathematical rigout). I use these with spaces on both sides, like a `:=` b not a`:=`b (note the spaces on either side of `:=`. This is because the notation means `is defined as` which itself needs spaces between the words.
	- Namely I use `:=` to mean defined as, `:~` to mean defined intuitively as (think of it as the $\approx$ in math instead of an $=$ sign.
	- I use `:-` to mean I am writing about this concept, but not an actual definition nor an intuitive definition, much like having a front or back to a [flashcard](flashcard___20250324_0938_53.pd). e.g. coding conventions :- help the code be more accessible to everyone.
