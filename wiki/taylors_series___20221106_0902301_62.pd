# taylor's_series
## introduction
## intuition
Error term can be written as $\frac{f^{(n+1)}(c}{(n+1)!}$
## rigour
## exam clinic
Remember standard expansions and then algebraically manipulate them to solve your equation.

So the general gist is to use a taylor expansion you already know of, and combine them accordingly. And to know when to stop (which just comes from practise I heard, plus it tends to 0 so anything that is bigger then x^2 in this case is going to go to zero)
