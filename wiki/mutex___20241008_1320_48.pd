# mutex
This is used to provide a locking mechanism.

mutex := mutually exclusive flag

- if one thread has the mutex it can execute
- the mutex gets passed to the next thread
- without the mutex the thread cannot run

	A mutex is like a bathroom key at a gas station, ensuring that only one person may use the bathroom at a time AND that no one else may use the toilet until the current occupant is finished and the key is returned. â€“
