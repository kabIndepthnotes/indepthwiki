# charge
A fundamental property of particles that determine how they interact via the [electromagnetic_force](electromagnetic_force___20251127_1045_03.pd).

We consider the net charge.

- different particles have difference charges,
- Protons: $+1e$
- Muons: $-1e$
- Quarks: $\pm \frac{1}{3} e$ or $\pm \frac{2}{3} e$
- Ions can be charged even after all electrons have been removed.
