Let $ \infty < \alpha < \beta < \infty$. If $ f: \left( \alpha , \beta \right) \to \mathbb{R}$ is continously differentiable and $ f ' (x_0) \neq 0$ for some $ x_0 \in (\alpha, \beta)$, then $f$ is invertible in a neighbourhood of $ x_0 $ and $ f ^{-1}    $ is a differentiable function such that 
\[
(f^{-1})'(y_0) = \frac{1}{f'(x_0)}
\]
where $ y_0 = f(x_0)$

If f is continous and injective in a neighbourhood of $x_0$ then this formula also works

# inverse_function_theorem
## introduction
$(f^-1)'(y_0) = \frac{1}{f'(f^-1(y_0))}$
## intuition
If f is continous and injective in a neighbourhood of $x_0$ then this formula also works
## rigour
Let $ \infty < \alpha < \beta < \infty$. If $ f: \left( \alpha , \beta \right) \to \mathbb{R}$ is continously differentiable and $ f ' (x_0) \neq 0$ for some $ x_0 \in (\alpha, \beta)$, then $f$ is invertible in a neighbourhood of $ x_0 $ and $ f ^{-1}    $ is a differentiable function such that \[
