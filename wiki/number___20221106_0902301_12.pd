prime:= An integer $p>1$ is called a prime number or a prime if it has not positive divisors other than $1$ and $p$. An integer $n >1$ is called composite if it is not prime.
Euclid's lemma:= Let $p$ be prime and $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$. Suppose $p|ab$ then $p|a$ or $p|b$.
Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:= Every integer $n>1$ can be expressed uniquely (up to reordering) as a product of primes.
Proof of the Fundamental theorem of Arithmetic
Case 1- if $p|a$, then we are done. Case 2- if p doesn't divide a, then $gcd(p,a) = 1$ and $\exists c \in \mathbb{Z} : ab=pc$ by the proposition.According to [[Bezouts_lemma]] $\exists u,v \in \mathbb{Z}, au + pv = 1 \implies (ba)u + p(bv) = b \implies p(cu) +p(bv) = b \implies p(cu+bv) = b$ hence p is a multiple of b, (in other words $p|b \square$) 

Algebraic:= A number is algebraic if it is a root of a non-zero polynomial with rational coefficients.

trancendental:= A number is trancendental if it is not algebraic
