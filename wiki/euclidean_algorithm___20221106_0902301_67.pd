## introduction

This algorithm finds the [gcd](gcd___20221106_090230_58.pd).
You find the remainder, $r = m mod n$ until $r = 0$.
And to get there you set $m = n, n = r$.

## intuition

## Bezouts_lemma
This is simply a fancy way of saying, the $gcd(a,b)$ is in the form $au+by$ u,v being (non-unique) integers.

#  Steps
as seen in [taocp](taocp___20250317_1141_16.pd)

1. [Find remainder.] Divide $m$ by $n$ and let $r$ be the remainder. (We will have $0 \le r < n$
2. [Is it zero?] If $r = 0$, the algorithm terminates; $n$ is the
[gcd](gcd___11_06_2022__090230_58.pd)
3. [Interchange] Set $m \leftarrow n, n \leftarrow r$ and go back to step `1.`

Using [computational_method](computational_method___20241013_1846_05.pd)
Let $Q$ be the set of all singletons $(n)$, all ordered pairs $(m,n)$ and all quadruples $(m,n,r,1), (m,n,r,2)$ and $(m,n,p,3)$, where $m,n$ and $p$ are positive integers and $r$ is a nonnegative integer.
Let $I$ be the subset of all pairs $(m,n)$ and let $\Omega$ be the subset of all singletons $(n)$.
Let $f$ be defined as follows.

$f(m,n) = (m,n,0,1); f(n) = (n)$

$f(m,n,r,1) = (m,n,\text{ remainder of m divided by n, 2});$

$f(m,n,r,2) = (n) \text{ if } r = 0, (m,n,r) \text{ otherwise }$ :~ check if $r = 0$ and if we are done

$f(m,n,p,3) = (n,p,p,1)$ :~ replace $n$ with the remainder $r$ (or in this case $p$)

# Worked example using rigour
1. find $gcd(52,21)$ using the rigourous definition of the euclidean algorithm.
$m `:=` 52$ and $n `:=` 21$.
$f((52,21)) = (52,21,0,1)$
$f((52,21,0,1)) = (52, 21, 10, 2)$
$f((52,21,10,2)) = (52, 21, 10, 3)$

$f((52,21,10,3)) = (21,10,10,1)$
$f((21,10,10,1)) = (21,10,1,2)$
$f((21,10,1,2)) = (21, 10, 1, 3)$
$f((21, 10, 1, 3)) = (21, 1, 1, 3)$
$f((21, 1, 1, 3)) = (21, 1, 0, 3)$
$f((21, 1, 0, 3)) = (1)$

We also need the restriction of finiteness, we need restrictions on the [[computational_method___20241013_184605|quadruple]].
Let $A$ be a finite et of letters, and let $A^{*}$ be the set of all strings on $A$, meaning the set of all ordered sequences, or combinations of letters $x_1x_2 \ldots x_n$, with $n\ge 0$ and $x_j \in A$ for all $1 \le j \le n$.
We want to encode the states of computation above so that they are represented by strings of $A^{}$
