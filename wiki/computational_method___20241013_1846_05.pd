# computational_method
<!-- visits: 55 -->
- This is a rigourous definition of an algorithm using set theory.

- computational method `:=` A quadruple, $\left( Q,I,\Omega, f \right)$ in which $Q$ is a set containing subsets $I$ and $\Omega$.
And f is a [function](function_math___20240724_1123_23.pd) $Q \to Q$.
$f$ should leave $\Omega$ pointwise fixed ($f(q) = q \forall q \in \Omega$)

- computational method :~ the quadruple $(Q,I,\Omega, f)$ is intended to represent respectively the states of the computation ($Q$), the input ($I$), the output($\Omega$), and the computational rule ($f$).

pointwise fixed `:=` $f(q)$ should equal $q$ for all $q \in \Omega$

#  The set $I$
Each $x \in I$ defines a computational sequence, $x_0,x_1,x_2,\ldots,$ with $x_0 = x$ and $f(x_k) = x_{k+1}$ for $k \ge 0$

A computational sequence is said to terminate in $k$ steps if $k$ is the smallest integer for which $x_k$ is in $\Omega$, and is said to produce output $x_k$ from $x$ (Recall the pointwise property of $\Omega$)

#  What are the specific rigourous conditions required for a computational method to become an algorithm?
If $\forall x \in I$ the computational method terminates, then it is an algorithm.

# How do we force effectiveness?
We essentially turn the states of the algorithm (blocks in the flowchart) to be words, and we want the words to be as short as possible.
If we wish to restrict the notation of algorithm so that only elementary operations are involved, we can place restrictions on the quadruple of the computational method, $Q, I, \Omega$ and $f$, for example as follows:

Let $A$ be a finite set of letters, and let $A^{*}$ be the set of all strings on $A$, or $A^{*}$ is words.
(i.e., the set of all ordered sequences $x_1x_2\ldots x_n$, where $n \ge 0$ and $x_j$ is in $A$ for $1 \le j \le n$).
The idea is to encode the states of the computation, $Q$, so that they are represented by strings of $A^{*}$.
Now let $N$ be a nonnegative integer and let $Q$ be the set of all $\left( \sigma, j \right)$, where $\sigma \in A^{*}$ and $j$ is an integer, $0\le j \le N$;
Let $I$ be the subset of $Q$ with $j=0$ ($j = 0$ represents that this is the starting state) and let $\Omega$ be the subset with $j = N$ which shows the ending state.
If $\theta$ and $\sigma$ are strings in $A^{*}$, we say that $\theta$ occurs in $\sigma$ if $\sigma$ has the form $\alpha \theta \omega$ for strings $\alpha$ and $\omega$. To reiterate, $\sigma = \alpha \theta \omega$.
To complete our definition, let $f$ be a function of the following type, defined by the strings $\theta_j,\phi_j$ and the integers $a_j$, $b_j$ for $0 \le j \le N$:

$f((\sigma,j)) = \left(\left( \sigma,a_j \right)\right)$ if $\theta _j$ does not occur in $\sigma$;	:~ you carry the state of computation to another step number.

$f((\sigma,j)) = \left(\left( \alpha \phi_j \omega ,b_j \right)\right)$ if $\alpha$ is the shortest possible string for which $\sigma = \alpha \theta _j \omega$; $\theta_j$ does occur in $\sigma$

$f((\sigma,N)) = ((\sigma,N))$
"""

## intuition of effectiveness
- We perform a search and replace on the data. $\theta_j$ is what we search for and $\phi_j$ is what we replace with.
- If we find the pattern, we go to $\beta_j$, if not we go to $\alpha_j$. $\beta_j$ and $\alpha_j$ are the step numbers. If it helps, it is like the line of code you execute.

We need the states of computation to be ordered.
