#  null_statement
Just one semicolon with no instruction.
Used in looping to not allow the loop to happen but no execution is needed in the body.

~~~{.c .numberLines}
// dummy example
for (int i; i < 10; i++); // simply iterates through with no body.
for (d = 2; d < n && n % d != 0; d++); // a more real-world example of the null statement use case
~~~


Another and pretty much the only other use case for null statemtents are when adding [jump_statement](jump_statement___20240610_1010_43.pd) labels in a [compound_statement](compound_statement___20240605_1151_46.pd)
