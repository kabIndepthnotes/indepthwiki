# function math

<!-- visits: 5 -->

## introduction
This is some sort of mapping, used to add rigour to math, such as addition, subtraction. Among many other things that I hope to document in the future.

## intuition
A map, from the domain to the range.

## rigour
injective:= one-to-one := if $f(x_1) = f(x_2) \implies x_1 = x_2$. This intuitively means that each input maps to a unique output.

surjective:= onto := If for $f: A \rightarrow B ,  \forall y \in B, \exists x \in A : y = f(x)$f is a surjection. AKA Let $f:X \rightarrow Y$. We say $f$ is *surjective* if for all $y \in Y$, there exists $x \in X$ such that $y=f(x)$. This intuitively means that for every possible output there is some input that is sent to it.

bijective := invertible := injective and surjective.

natural domain:= This is an informal term to describe a domain that is natural. That is to say for what domain is the function well defined, so no division by 0 or no logs of negatives or negative of sqrts
