if $f$ is convex

f(average) $\le$ Average(f)

$f(\sum _{k=1}^{n} x_k) \le \sum _{k=1}^{n} f(x_k)$

We can average this, every case of the function is less than, so if we sum each then divide by n, then we still have the same inequality.

f(g) + m(t-g) <= f(t)

"If I score better every test last year, then my average will always be better than last year"

jensens_inequality:= if f is convex, f(average) $\le$ Average(f)
