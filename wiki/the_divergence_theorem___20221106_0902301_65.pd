This also reminds me of A-level, when you are taught that there is a form of a plane in normal for and cartesian form, I wouldn't be suprised if that is because of this theorem.
# rigour
Used in solid regions
$\int\int \int \nabla \cdot v dx dy dz  = \int \int v \cdot n d \sigma$ think of link between tangents and norma
