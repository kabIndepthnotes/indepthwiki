## intuition
Think back to the idea of forming a line from a set of points. Now the word "linear" does not mean straight line, but rather, linearity in terms of vectors.

So how does the graph come from the equation, $Y_i = \beta_0+\beta_1X_i$ (I have set the $\phi$ function to be the trivial map in this case) Now the parameters, $\beta_0, \beta_1$ are the y-intercept and slope respectively

Now any "x" on the graph are mere data points
