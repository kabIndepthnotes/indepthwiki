# ball
## introduction
%%visits: 6
Imagine a real ball but more abstracted, it doesn't have to be a ball shape, but it has that name because it has a radius and points that live in the radius are the elements of the ball.

It is something that has a center,$c_0$ and a radius, $r$, and what is contained in the ball is governed by a [[metric]], all points that are at most $r$ away.

There is the idea of disc in complex_analysis which is a specific metric.
