# diode
- let's current flow in one direction only

- forward bias `:=` direction in which current is allowed to flow (direction of conventional current)
- usually a threshold voltage of about 0.6v before they will conduct
- In the reverse bias, the resistance of the diode is very high and the current that flows is very tiny.
