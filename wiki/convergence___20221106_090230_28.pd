D’Alembert’s Criterion := $\lim_{n \to \infty} |\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} |$ is less than 1 if $\sum^{n} a_n$ is convergent and is greater than 1 if $\sum^{n} a_n$ is divergent. It is inconclusive otherwise.

Convergence, every number in the sequence, eventually will stay within any given error window of the number they should become.
# rigour
A sequence ${a_n}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to a limit $a \in \mathbb{R}$, if $\forall \epsilon > 0 \exists N \in \mathbb{N}: \forall n \ge N : \left| a_n - a\right| < \epsilon$
monotone := non-increasing (all later terms are lower than or equal) or non-decreasing (all later terms are greater than or equal)
Cauchy_convergence 

Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem := Every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence := Let ${x_{n}}_{n=1}^{\infty} \subset [a,b];$ then ${x_{n}}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ has a limit point in $[a,b]$
