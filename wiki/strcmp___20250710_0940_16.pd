# strcmp

- compares strings and returns a real number.


~~~{.c .numberLines}
if (strcmp(str1, str2) < 0) { /* is str1 < str2 */
	/* do something */
}

# s1 is less than s2 when?
- first $i$ chars are the same but `s1[i+1]` char is less than `s2[i+1]`. for example `s1 = "abca"` `s2 = "abcd"` $\implies$ `s1 < s2`.
- s1 is the same string as s2 but truncated.

This follows the [ascii](ascii___20250717_1103_07.pd) character set.
