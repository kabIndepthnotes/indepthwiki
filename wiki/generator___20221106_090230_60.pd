## intuition==
We can extend the generator notation to accommodate two symbols, for example $\left< a , b \right>$, which can make an infinite list of elements in the group generated by this ($\left\{ a,b,ab,aba,abab, \ldots  \right\}$ or $\left\{ a,ab,aab,aaab,aaaab,aaaaab, \ldots \right\}$ or any other combination you can think of

"Clearly $\left< a \right> \subset \left< a,b \right>$ and $\left< b \right> \subset \left< a,b \right>$, $\left< a,b \right>$ is the intersection of all subgroups containing both $a$ and  $b$."
