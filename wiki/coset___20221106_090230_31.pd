# coset
## introduction

Define an equivalence relation ~ by:
- $a~b \iff ba^{-1} \in H$

The equivalence class of $a\in G$ under this equivalence relation:

$\left[ a \right] \equiv \left\{ b \in G | b~a \right\}$, which is called right-coset
$S_3 = \left< a,b \right>$ with $a^3 = e$, $b^2=e$, $b^2=e$, $ab=ba^2$

Cosets, are disjoint, same number of elements and they together cover the main set. Aka they are equipartition.

Two right cosets of G w.r.t $H \subset G$ are either disjoint or identical. 

## intuition

Cosets: can be defined without group theory

Subsets : $H \subset G$ with an equivalence_relation

Coset `:=` $Y \subset X$ with $y_1~y_2 \forall y_1,y_2 \in Y$

Suppose $Y_1,Y_2$ are both cosets of $(X,~)$.
then either $y_1H = y_2H$ so they describe the same coset
Or $y_2H\neq y_1H$ so they are not the same coset.
Proof that all elements belong to a coset. :todo:
$\sqcup yH = X$
cosets make partitions
proof :todo:

What is a coset space?

The set of all cosets

Cosets are a sort of division, as they partition.
## rigour
## exam clinic
when proving isomorphisms, think, are they the same elements, and do they have the same multiplication law.

What is a right coset space?
consider different coset spaces:
$\left[ x \right] =\left[ y \right]$ or $\left[ x \right] \cap \left[ y \right] = \Phi$

And one way to denote a coset is in element-subgroup notation.

$H \setminus G$


Coset space, what is the equivalence_relation that
