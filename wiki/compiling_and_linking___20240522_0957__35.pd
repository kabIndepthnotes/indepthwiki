# preprocessor
In C, the preprocessor is like an editor, it processes commands beginning with `#` and modifies the source code.
see [[preprocessor___20241010_161929]] for details

# compiler

It has references to computer objects that may be defined elsewhere, this needs to be linked by the linker.

# linker
