# special_orthogonal_group
## introduction
%%visits: 2
The structure of the special_orthogonal_group is called a sphere with diametrically opposed points being equal. This is basically saying that the poles are equal and you can move the poles around anywhere you want it too. 

This is not in Euclidean space. (! :todo: check if true)
## intuition
If $N$ is odd then $O(N) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2 \times SO(N)$

This is geometrically a [[rotation_matrix]], but the "diametrically opposed" points mean that they are mirrored.

$SO(3)$ is structurally a funny shape. It is not a shape in Euclidean space. And it can be shown as matrices in the form $\begin{pmatrix} 1 &0&0\\0 & \cos \theta & \sin \theta \\ 0 & -\sin \theta & \cos \theta \end{pmatrix}$ or something [[similar_matrices|similar]] 
## rigour
special_orthogonal_group:= $\{A \in O(n)|\det(A) = 1\} $

Theorem: If $A \in SO(3) \implies \exists \hat{n} \in \mathbb{R}^3: A\hat{n}=\hat{n}$
