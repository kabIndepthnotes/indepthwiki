# numeric escape sequences
These are used when we want to go beyond the current escape sequences and represent any character.

octal escape sequences:= at most three digits, e.g. `\33` or `\033`

hexadecimal escape sequences:= cannot exceed an unsigned character e.g. `\x1b`

Note that the escape sequence only ends when it reaches the first non-hex/octal character.
`"Z\xfcrich"` gives us `"Zurich"` but`"\xfcber"` could catch `"[\xcbe]r"` as `r` is the only non-hex character.
Most compilers would reject `\xcbe` as the range is `\x0 - \xff`
