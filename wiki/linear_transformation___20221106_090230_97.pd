## introduction
%%visits: 2
The dimension of a space or linear transformation is how many vectors are in a basis of the range.
$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ has dimension 3
$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ has dimension 2
## intuition
Think about orthogonality, basis that cannot interact with each other. A [[basis]] is the maximum numbber of vectors that are orthogonal to each other.
