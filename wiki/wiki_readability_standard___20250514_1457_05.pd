- Reads very well like a donald knuth book, has appropriate humour or engagement as is fun to read, very insightful, should be behind a paywall because it is that good.
- It contains polished equations (possibly colorised) or professional looking figures.
- It has been seen by other people and regarded as a helpful, informative, elegant solution.
- It could be the reason that fans subscribe to patreon etc.
- Is sufficiently terse.

- [gold](gold___20250527_1447_20.pd) should be readable by the target audience, possibly everyone. Is production ready.
- [silver](silver___20250527_1447_54.pd) recommendable to a friend, but may need more work to be production ready.
- [bronze](bronze___20250527_1448_32.pd) usable by me, but only just.
- [wood](wood___20250527_1447_59.pd) so unreadable that it cannot be used by even me.
