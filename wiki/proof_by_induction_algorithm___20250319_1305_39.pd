# proof_by_induction_algorithm


# Given a positive integer $n$ this algorithm will output a proof that $P(n)$ is true.

1. prove P(1)
set $k \leftarrow 1$, and, according to [proof_by_induction step 1](proof_by_induction___20250319_1259_06.pd), output a prof of $P(1)$

2. k = n?
If $k = n$, terminate the algorithm, we are done

3. Prove P(K+1)
output proof of "If all of $P(1),\ldots,P(k)$ are true, then $P(k+1)$ is true."
Also output "We have already proved that $P(1),\ldots,P(k)$ are true, hence $P(K+1)$ is true"

4. increase $k$ by $1$ and go to step `2`
