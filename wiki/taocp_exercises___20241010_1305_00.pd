2. Without exercises learning is stunted.
Doing questions helps test knowledge and check if there are any gaps in understanding.
Math is not a spectator sport.

3. $13^{3} : =13 \times 13 \times 13 := (13 \times 13) \times 13$
By definition, multiplication is related to addition in the following way.
$x \times n := \sum _{i=1}^{n} x$.
so $13 \times 13 = \sum _{i=1}^{13} 13 = 169$.
We do the same step.
$169 \times 13 = \sum _{i=1}^{13} 169 = 2197$

4. Fermat's last theorem, unsolvable by me with current ability, TODO look at proof

#  1.1 exercises
n. swap $a$ and $b$, $a$ and $c$, $a$ and $d$ ($3 \times 3$ steps of replacement) TODO see if we can cut the $9$ replacements down even further by exploiting unnecessary temp variable calls

$t \leftarrow a$ $b \leftarrow a$ $a \leftarrow t$
$t \leftarrow b$ $c \leftarrow b$ $b \leftarrow t$
$t \leftarrow c$ $d \leftarrow c$ $c \leftarrow t$

# 1.1 answer book
$t \leftarrow a$ (save $a$ state)
$a \leftarrow b, b \leftarrow c, c \leftarrow d, d \leftarrow t$

#  1.1 q2
In step `3`, we know that $m \leftarrow n$ and $n \leftarrow r$, so it is sufficient to prove that $r < n$.
we have $m = an + r$ where $a$ is the largest number that satisfies the equation.
For sake of contradiction, suppose that $r \ge n$, this implies $r = n + b$ where $b \ge 0$
$\implies m = an + n + b$
$\implies m = (a+1)n + b$ which is a contradiction, we assumed that $a$ is the largest number that satisies the equation of that form.

#  1.1 q3
TODO wrong, it requires 3 is zero checks and 3 remainder checks, see answerbook
The [[the_euclidean_algorithm___11_06_2022__090230167|Steps]] is as follows.

3. [Interchange] Set $m \leftarrow \left\lfloor \frac{m}{n} \right\rfloor, n \leftarrow m \% n$ 
2. [Is it zero?] If $n = 0$, the algorithm terminates; $m$ is the [[gcd___11_06_2022__09023058|gcd___11_06_2022__09023058]] and go back to step `1.`

#  1.1 q6
The average number of times the step `E1` will be computed with $n \leftarrow 5$.
TODO plug in $m = 1,2,3,4,5$ and then find average.

#  1.1. q7
The number of times an algorithm executes `E1` is well defined as we know that `E1` is deterministic and finite.
We then divide by $n$ and take a limit for the set of $\mathbb{R}$.
$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\text{ The number of times E1 is executed }}{n}$
This in unambiguous, in other words well defined.

With step `E0`, $U_m$ and $T_n$ are the same.

Without it there would be a step involving the switch of the two.
$U_m = T_n + 1$ where $m < n$
$U_m = T_n$ otherwise.

# answerbook
In all but a finite number of cases, $n > m$.
In this caase, the first iteration of Algorithm `E` merely exchanges these numbers; so $U_m = T_m + 1$

#  1.1 q8
TODO
We are given.

$f((m,n)) = (m,n,0,1);	f((n)) = (n);$

$f((m,n,r,1)) = (m,\min(m,n),\left| m - n \right| , 2);$

$f((m,n,r,2)) = (n) \text{ if } r = 0, (m,n,r,3) \text{ otherwise };$

$f((m,n,p,3)) = (n,p,p,1)$

# answerbook
Let $A = \{a,b,c\}, N = 5$.
The algorithm will terminate with the string $a^{gcd(m,n)}$

# 1.1 q9

# 1.2.1 exercises
1. We can modify the idea of the proof by mathematical induction, by first proving $P(0)$ and $P(1)$ then continuing as normal.
We can also do, $P(0)$ then assume true for $1,2,\ldots,n$ to then prove $n+1$

3. The formula is not defined for $n=1$ as $\frac{1}{(n-1) \times n}$ will be $\frac{1}{0 \times 1}$ which is undefined.
Because the iteration is not defined, (when we hav $1 \ldots 0$ do we do just $1$ or just $0$

If we are to do induction, we have to start at $n=2$, but.
$\frac{1}{1 \times 2} \stackrel{!}{=} \frac{3}{2} - \frac{1}{2}$
$\text{ L.H.S } = \frac{1}{2}$ but
$\text{ R.H.S } = 1$ CONTRADICTION.

4.
Recall, $\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} }{2}$

W.T.S $\phi^{n -2} \le F_n$ where $F_n$ is the $n$th term in the [fibonnaci](fibonacci___20250319_1332_58.pd)  sequence.

## base case
For $n=1$, $F_1 = 1$ and $\phi^{1-2} = \frac{2}{1 + \sqrt{5} }$
We know that the square root function is monotonic for numbers greater than $1$, and $\sqrt{4} = 2$,so $1+ \sqrt{5} > 1 + 2 = 3$.
$\implies \phi^{-1} < 1$

For $n=2$, $F_2 = 1$ and $\phi^{0} = 1$ and so we havee $\phi^{0} \le F_2$

For $n=3$, $F_3 = 2$ and $\phi^{1} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} }{2} \approx 1.618$ and so we have $\phi^{1} \le F_3$

For $n=4$, $F_4 = 3$ and $\phi^{2} \approx 2.618$ and so we have $\phi^{2} \le F_4$

With foresight, the inductive step uses $2^{n-4}$ so I wanted to make sure that this doesn't cause any issues and figured out $1 \le n \le 4$ explicitly.

# assume true for $\forall j : 1 < j < n$ to prove true for $n$

$$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$

As we are dealing with all positive numbers, we have 

$$\implies \phi^{n-3} + \phi^{n-4} \le F_n$$.

We need to show $\phi^{n-2} \le \phi^{n-3} + \phi^{n-4}$.

Plug in the formula values.
$$\text{ LHS } = \frac{\left( 1 + \sqrt{5} \right)^{n-2}  }{2^{n-2}}$$

$$\text{ RHS } = \frac{\left( 1 + \sqrt{5} \right)^{n-3}  }{2^{n-3}} + \frac{\left( 1 + \sqrt{5} \right)^{n-4}  }{2^{n-4}}$$

$$= \frac{\left( 1 + \sqrt{5} \right)^{n-3}  }{2^{n-3}} + \frac{2 \times \left( 1 + \sqrt{5} \right)^{n-4}  }{2^{n-3}}$$

$$= \frac{\left( 1 + \sqrt{5} \right)^{n-3}  + 2 \times \left( 1 + \sqrt{5} \right)^{n-4}  }{2^{n-3}}$$

$$= \frac{2 \times \left( 1 + \sqrt{5} \right)^{n-3}  + 4 \times \left( 1 + \sqrt{5} \right)^{n-4}  }{2^{n-2}}$$

We only need to compare numerators, we WTS, $\left( 1 + \sqrt{5} \right)^{n-2} \le 2 \times \left( 1 + \sqrt{5} \right)^{n-3}  + 4 \times \left( 1 + \sqrt{5} \right)^{n-4}$

$u := 1 + \sqrt{5}$

$u^{n-2} \le 2 u^{n-3} + 4u^{n-4}$
$\implies u^{2}u^{n-4} \le 2 u^{n-4} u + 4u^{n-4}$
$\implies u^2 \le 2u + 4$
We can now plug in the values.

$\implies (1 + sqrt{5})^2 = 6 + 2\sqrt{5} \le 2(1 + sqrt{5}) + 4 = 6 + 2\sqrt{5} \square$

# 5. prove that every positve integer $> 2$ can be written as a product of primes.

## base case
$n=2$ we are done as $2$ is a prime.

# assume true for $2 \le j < n$ to prove true for $n$
For sake of contradiction, suppose that $n$ cannot be expressed as a product of primes.
Why would this be the case?
$n$ must have at least $2$ factors, as it is greater than 1, and $n$ itself is a factor of $n$.
But it must have more factors, as if it only had $2$ factors than $n$ is prime and we are done, we have a expression of a product of primes.

If it had a factor $a^{i} = n, i > 1$, We must have that $a < n$, and therefore by our assumption $a$ can be expressed as a product of primes. so $n = a = p_1 \ldots p_n$.
In fact, any factor has the property of being less than $n$ and therefore by our induction step we know it is expressed as a factor of primes. $\square$

6.

Wts if $a'm + b'n = c, am + bn = d$ hold before step 4 on the [euclidean_algorithm](euclidean_algorithm___11_06_2022__0902301_67.pd), then they hold after.

Set $c \leftarrow d$,

We have $d = a'm + b'n$

 $d \leftarrow r$,
We have $am + bn = r$

 $t \leftarrow a'$,
 $a' \leftarrow a$,
We have $d = am + b'n$

 $a \leftarrow t - qa$,
 $t \leftarrow b'$,
 $b' \leftarrow b$,
 $b \leftarrow t - qb$ Go to step `2`.

We have $d = a'm + b'n$

| t  | a    | a'   | b | b' | m | n | c | d |
| -  | -    | -    | - | -  | - | - | - | - |
| a' | t-qa | a    |   |    |   |   | d | r |
| b' |      | t-qb | b |    |   |   |   |   |

$am + bn = d$ and $am  + bn = r$

7.
$$1^2 = 1$$
$$2^2 - 1^2 = 3$$
$$3^2 - 2^2 + 1^2 = 6$$
$$4^2 - 3^2 + 2^2 - 1^2 = 10$$
$$5^2 - 4^2 + 3^2 - 2^2 + 1^2 = 15$$

Note that we have the difference of 2 squares formula, with the second parenthesis equal to 1.

$$1^2 = (1 + 0) (1-0$$
$$2^2 - 1^2 = (2 + 1) )(2-1)$$

We need to delete every other term. which we do with $n+i \mod 2$.

$$\sum _{i = 1} ^{n} \left( i + (i - 1) \right)  ((n + i) \mod 2)$$


## Proof
Case $n=1$, $\sum _{i=1}^{1} i + (i-1) ((1+i)\mod 2)$
$$= (1 + 0) (2 \mod 2)$$
