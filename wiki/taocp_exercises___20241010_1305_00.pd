2. Without exercises learning is stunted.
Doing questions helps test knowledge and check if there are any gaps in understanding.
Math is not a spectator sport.

3. $13^{3} : =13 \times 13 \times 13 `:=` (13 \times 13) \times 13$
By definition, multiplication is related to addition in the following way.
$x \times n `:=` \sum _{i=1}^{n} x$.
so $13 \times 13 = \sum _{i=1}^{13} 13 = 169$.
We do the same step.
$169 \times 13 = \sum _{i=1}^{13} 169 = 2197$

4. Fermat's last theorem, unsolvable by me with current ability, TODO look at proof

#  q1. suppose that you wishto obtain a devimal digit at random, not using a computer. Which of the following methods would be suitable?

#  1 a)
The user would be primed not to select a number from the beginning or end.
Is the telephone directories' first digit of each page uniformly distributed?
The units digit is sufficiently "chaotic" in a telephone directory organised by name.
The user might be primed to select a page in the middle however, and so that might skew the distribution.
The user won't pick the first few pages as it doesn't seem "random enough"

#  1 b)
This does seem sufficiently chaotic.

#  1 c)
Suitable.

#  1 d)
Suitable.
Though not as quickly reproducible.

#  1 e)
Suitable though not as quickly reproducible.

#  1 f)
Not suitable, as the distribution of numbers choses are not uniform enough.
People chose 1 or 10 the most, then 3 or 7 as they seem like "random numbers"

#  1 g)
Not suitable, as the enemy might find out your desire and chose a non-random number.
i.e. chose 1 all the time.

#  1 h)
This is sufficiently random, as long as the numbers assigned each race are random each time.

#  2)
$\frac{1}{10}^{1000000} \times $
$(1,000,000 C 100,000) \times (900,000 C 100,000) \times \ldots \times (100,000 C 100,000)$

$= \frac{1}{10^{1,000,000}} \times \frac{1,000,000!}{100,000! (900,000!)} \times \frac{900,000!}{100,000! (800,000!)} \times \ldots \times \frac{100,000!}{100,000! (0!)} $


$= \frac{1}{10^{1,000,000}} \times \frac{1,000,000!}{1,000,000}$

$\frac{999,999!}{10^{1,000,000}}$

#  3)
Look at K4 in the algorithm.
3040504030

#  4)
In step K11, $X$ cannot be $0$ as in the previous step, $X$ must be positive:
Either $X$ is set to be $X^2 + 99999$, which means that $X$ is always positive as it is squared then added a positive number, then added by $99999$ so it must be greater than $99,998$
Or $X > 100000$ means in the next step $X - 99999$, $X$ is at least $1$.

If $X$ could be $0$ then in step K12 we would get a division by $0$ error.
$X(X-1) = 0 \times -1$
$= 0$
The step requires $\left\lfloor \frac{0}{10^{5}} \right\rfloor$ which is indeterminate.

#  5)
It can only provide 10-digit numbers.
Because we are constrained to deterministic methods, we can know that one number leads to another, which leads to another.
