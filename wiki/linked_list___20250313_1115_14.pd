# linked_list


# What is linked list ?

Linked list is an linear data structure, which consists of a group of nodes in a sequence, which dynamic length.
A linked list is where I store data in linear from.

# Pros and cons
- Pros:
	1. Dynamically (during runtime and whenever you want) add and remove
	2. Optimal insertion & deletion
	3. Stack's & queues can be easily implemented
	4. No memory wastage

- Cons:
	1. Memory usage due to address pointer
	2. Slow traversal compared to arrays
	3. No reverse traversal in singly linked list
	4. No random access like hash maps

# Types of linked list
- singly linked list :- each node points to the next node and the last node points to `NULL`
- doubly linked list :- each node points to the next node and previous node. Each node has 2 pointers.
- circular linked link :- singly linked list but the last node points to the first node.
- circular doubly linked list :~ circular linked list and doulble linked list combined.

# Time complexity
- Access: O(n)
- Search: O(n)
- Insert: O(1)
- Remove: O(1)
