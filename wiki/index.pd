# Indepthwiki
This is my lifelong library of knowledge that I have accumulated.
I have taken over five years refining this wiki with frequent changes.
This is a [zetelkasten](zetelkasten___20250527_1432_52.pd) with a [wiki_readability_standard](wiki_readability_standard___20250514_1457_05.pd).

I try be like <https://based.cooking>.
A site that has what you need, and none of the fluff to keep you on the site to sell you more ads.
This means no scrolling to the bottom to get to the actual thing you want.

This wiki in on github! see <https://github.com/kabIndepthnotes/indepthwiki>
