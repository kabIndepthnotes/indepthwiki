# graph
## introduction
%%visits: 3
This is a [[set]] of vertices and edges. Vertices are end points, and edges must connect points.
## intuition
walk:~ A way to traverse between one point and another.
trail:~ Think of a normal trail down a park. In a trail, you don't mind going in a loop around a point, the main point is that you don't want to walk the same edge again and again.
path:~ Think of a path to get from point $a$ to $b$. Now loops of are pointless. I want to get from point $a$ to $b$ so why do I want to go around in circles? This is the idea behind.
## rigour
length of the wal `:=` the number of edges in the walk.
