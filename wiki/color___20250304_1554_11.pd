# color


hsv, hsb `:=` hue saturation and value (or brightness)
cymk `:=` cyan magenta yello and key, this is additive color

Hue can be thought of as where in the color wheel you are.
Red is at $0^{\cdot}$ ... green is at $180^{\cdot}$ ... red again at $360^{\cdot}$.

In [grafx2](grafx2___20250305_1449_44.pd), hsv are all represented as 8-bit integers (their value goes from 0-255).
