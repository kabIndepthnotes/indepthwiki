# continuity
## introduction
%%visits: 4
If you find a range for the outputs, I can find a range for the inputs, that the output will always be in.

$f \in C[a,b]$ `:=` f is continuous and $f(a) = \lim_{x \to a_+} f(x)$ and $f(b) = \lim_{x \to b_{_}}f(x)$

## intuition
"nearby points in the domain map to nearby points in the range"
Epsilon is small. Any change in x should mean that the change in y is not too "jumpy".
continuity and [[convergence]]
$\lim_{x \to x_0} f(x) = y_0 \iff \forall$ sequence $x_n \in (a,b) :\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = x_0$ we have $\lim_{n \to \infty} f(x_n) = y_0$

If $f$, and $g$ are continuous
    - $f + g$ is continuous
    - $fg$ is continuous
    - $f(g)$ is continuous

Continuous in general means continuous at every point.
