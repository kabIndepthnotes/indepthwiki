#  algorithm

#  features of an algorithm
1. finite: Must terminate after $n< \infty$ steps.
2. Definiteness: Each step must be precisely defined.
3. Input: If you think of a function, then the algorithm should take an input., eg 2 positive integers in the euclidean algorithm
4. Output: It should evaluate to an answer
5. Effectiveness: Each step must be computable.

#  How do I get effectiveness?

#  effectiveness
"This means that all of the operations to be performed in the algortithm must be sufficiently basic that they can in principle be done exactly and in a finite length of time by a man using pencil and paper."
