# complex numbers

%%visits: 4

## introduction
It was first created to support the fundamental theorem of calculus, since some quadratics, such as $x^2 +1 = 0$ do not have any roots, however they needed 2 (or 1 repeated root).
Hence $i$ was created.

- $i$ `:=` A number which satisfies, $i^2 = -1$

- $0$ is an imaginary and real number

## intuition
Thing of the complex_numbers as a vector with a special multiplication defined to it, but to build the complex_numbers rigorously actually needs a lot of sophisticated ideas and such to it.

complex_numbers `:~` $\mathbb{C} = \mathbb{R}^2+ \text{field multiplication}$

## rigour
- polar form is  $z = r(cos(\theta)+ isin(\theta))$
- exponential form is  $z = e^{i\theta}$
- regular form = a +bi

let $u_1,u_2,v_1,v_2 \in \mathbb{R}$, then the field multiplication for a complex_number in vector form is defined by $\begin{pmatrix} u_1\\ u_2 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} v_1\\ v_2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1v_1 - u_2v_2 \\ u_1v_2 + v_1u_2 \end{pmatrix}$

complex conjugate `:=` $x - i y$
