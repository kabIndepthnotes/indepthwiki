#  clusters and why are they important
clusters:= groupings of pixels that share a single colour. This helps with understanding the resolution of the image, as an image scaled x times will still have the same cluster shapes. Clusters interact top, bottom, left and right.

lines define clusters in the negative space.

meta-clusters:= meta-clusters are clusters that connect to other clusters (of different colours of course) up down left or right.

implicit cluster:= When [[anti_aliasing___20240704_092417|anti_aliasing]] we can create a series of individual pixels which are in the direction of a line, which then causes an implicit cluster

resolution:= the size of the smallest apparent cluster.
