# contour_integral
## introduction
%%visits: 5
This is a generalisation of [[integral]] on the "[[complex_number]] line". It allows us to calculate real integrals much easier then without them.

Complex functions take $(x,y)$ and map them to $(x,y)$, so there are 4 dimensions to the integral, and the bounds are typically 2d shapes, hence visualising them are no longer thought about as a way to understand them.

## exam clinic
1. First thing to note is that if the function is [[holomorphic]] in all of the region, then the integral is 0.
2. [[Cauchys_integral_formula]] or [[Cauchys_residue_theorem]], Goursats_theorem
3. Parameterisations.

Fundamental estimate would come last, it is really mainly used when making proofs
