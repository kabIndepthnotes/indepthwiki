mean_value_theorem application to area analysis

$f: (a,b) \to \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable. If an extremum is reached, then there exists a point in the interval, $c$ such that $f'(c) = 0$

Sketch, left and right limits exists, and left and right are opposite signs, so must be 0.

non-example of extreme_value_theorem.

$f(x) = -|x| \le 0$. Extremised (extremum) at x=0 but not differentiable.

mean_value_theorem:=  Let $f \in C[a,b]$ be differentiable on $(a,b)$. Then there exists $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}$

mean_value_theorem:~ The line that bisects two points on a smooth graph, has the same gradient as at least 1 point on that line.

proof of mean_value_theorem. Let $F(t) = (f(t) - f(a)) - \left( \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a} \right) (t-a) $ (this is a linear approximate) as $t\to a$ then it tends to 0 :todo:
