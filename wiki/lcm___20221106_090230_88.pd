# lcm
## introduction
%%visits: 2
## intuition
The relationship between the [[gcd]] and the lcm is, Let $a,b$ be non-zero integers. Then $gcd(a,b)lcm(a,b) = |ab|$
## rigour
the $lcm(a,b) = min(\left\{ c : a|c $and $b|c\right\})$

If $a,b$ are integers, then a common multiple of $a$ and $b$ is an integer c such that $a|c$ and $b|c$. The lcm is the lowest positive number which is a common multiple of $a$ and $b$.
