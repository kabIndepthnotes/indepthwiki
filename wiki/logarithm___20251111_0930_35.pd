# logarithm
- suppose we have $y$, can we find a real number $x$ such that $y = b^{x}$

- $x = b^{\log_{b}\left(x\right)} = log_b\left(b^{x}\right)$
- $\log_b\left(xy\right) = \log_b\left(x\right) + \log_b\left(y\right)$, if $x > 0$ and $y > 0$
- $\log_b\left(c^{y}\right) = y\log_b\left(c\right)$ if $c > 0$
- $\log_c\left(x\right) = \frac{\log_b x}{\log_b c}$

- $\lg$ `:=` $\log_2$, is quite useful since most computers do binary arithmetic, and computer algorithms often make two-way branches.

# natural logarithm
- was the first logarithm discovered
- derived from the integral of $\frac{1}{x}$
- another way is $\lim_{n \to \infty}\left[ \left( 1 + \frac{x}{n} \right) ^{n} \right] = e^{x}$. $x$ is like an interest rate and we are compounding it to $\infty$
