# declaration
declaration :~ described for the benefit of the compiler.

declaration := specificy a variable type and name.

# assignment
give a variable a value, this is different than a initialisation.
[operator](operator___20240603_1153_38.pd# assignment operator)


# initialisation
This is specifically something that happens when a statement is being declared.
The `=` in `int i = 0` is not the assignment operator, they are $2$ different things.
TODO expand upon this.

#  local variable
local variable:~ a variable defined in a scope like within a function

local variables cannot be accessed outside the function it is defined

#  automatic variable
Automatic Storage Duration:= Automatic extent:= The portion of program execution during which storage of the variable exists. It gets allocated and deallocated automatically.

Block scope:= The portion of the program text where the variable can be referenced.


in [c99](c99___20250312_1237_53.pd) as you can declare a variable pretty much declare a variable whenever, the scope only starts when the variable is declared, allowing for very small scopes.

#static local variables

## A static local variable has a what kind of storage duration?
It has a static storage duration.
This means it has a permanent storage location.

It is hidden from other functions but retains its value for use in another call of the same function.

#  global variables
global variables have [[variable___20240731_101253#A static local variable has a what kind of storage duration?|static storage duration]] and file scope.

#  Scope
When a declaration inside a block names an identifier that's already visible, the new declaration temporarily "hides" the old one and the indentifier takes on a new meaning. At the end of the block the identifier regains its old meaning.

#  What is the difference between parameters and local variables?
They both have automatic sotrage duration and block scope.
The only difference is that the parameter is initalised automatically in a function call.
