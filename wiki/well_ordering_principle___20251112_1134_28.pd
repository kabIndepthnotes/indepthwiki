# well_ordering_principle
- The idea is that we want to be able to order the members of a set
- It is an abstraction of numbers being less than another, $1 < 2 < 3 < 4 \ldots $

# rigour
- Let $\prec$ be a relation on a set $S$, satisfying the following properties:
 	 - (transitive) Given $x,y,z \in S$, if $x \prec y$ and $y \prec z$ then $x \prec z$
 	 - (trichotomy or total) Given $x,y \in S$, exactly one of the following cases are true $x \prec y$, $y \prec x$ or $x = y$
 	 - (minimal element) If $A$ is any nonempty subset of $S$, there is an element $x \in A$ with
      - $x \preceq y$ (that is, $x \prec y$ or $x = y$) for all $y \in A$.
