## introduction
Lagrange's Theorem for group `:=` $\left| G \right| = \left| H \right| i(H,G)$

Corollaries of Lagrange's Theorem.

If $\left| G \right|$ is prime, then G has no subgroups

The order of a group generated by g, is k, then the k divides $\left| G \right|$

If $\left| G \right|$ is prime, then $G$ is a cyclic group.
## intuition
proof of Lagranges_theorem theorem uses cosets, mainly that they are disjoint and collectively exhausting, so the order of the group (the number of elements in it), are the number of cosets times the number of elements in any given subgroup.
## rigour
index of set H in group `:=` i(H,G `:=` The number of cosets of $G$ with respect to H.
