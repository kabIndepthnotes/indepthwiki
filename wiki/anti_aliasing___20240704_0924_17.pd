#  anti_aliasing, what is it?
Adding pixels of an intermediaty color to the intersections of clusters.
It blunts the edges.

note, the anti-aliasing pixel does not form a [[cluster___20240619_095817|cluster]] in of itself, rather it blends two clusters boudaries.

It is not good to simply trace the outline of a cluster, this is banding, and will make the sprite look blurred not smoothed.

Using a neutraliser

#  The longer the step are, then what?
The longer the steps, the longer the AA segments should be.
If you were dealing with a triangle, the flatter it is the more AA segments it should have.

AAing a 1-1 line or a 50/50 line is redundant.

Never let AA become it's own apparent cluster.
