Halfway is the pubic bone of the pelvis.
Quarter from the top is chest and goes through the nipples of a male chest.
1/8th is the head.
Sometimes the 1/8 ratio is between 1/6.5 - 1/8
Base of the neck is the supra neck, and tell you where the breast bone is.
half the width of the breast bone shows you where the nipples should be.
The rib cage is shaped like an egg, and is slightly above the waist line.
The height of the face (not head) is the same as the height of the breast bone (sternem) and also the length of the collar bone.
The pubis is in the middle in classical proportions.
The hip joints lie just above the pubis, the bottom of the ball shaped bone are right above the middle line.
The bottom 1/4 line is just below the knee joint.
The femur caves in slightly.

the height of the head is the same as it's depth.
This height of the head is the same as depth of the waist and the hips.
1/2 the height of the head is the same as the thickness of the arm (highly doubt) and the depth of leg at the knee joint.
The distance between the hairline and the top of the breastbone is equal to the depth of the chest and the length of the foot.
