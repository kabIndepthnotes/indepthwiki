## what is a+b

Let $A = \{x,y\}$.
let $a$ be encoded as $x^{a}$.
Let $b$ be encoded as $y^{b}$.

| j | θj      | φj      | a_j | b_j | Comment                                             |
| - | ------- | ------- | --- | --- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 0 | `y`     | `x`     | 1   | 0   | If a `b` occurs, change it to `a` and repeat step 0 |
| 1 | (empty) | (empty) | 1   | 1   | No `b`s remain → halt                               |

Let's try $5+2$.
$\theta = x^{5}y^{2}$.
We start with $j = 0$.

$f\left( \left( x^{5}y^{2}, 0 \right)  \right) = \left( x^{6}y, 0\right)$
$\theta_j = y$ which is in $\theta = x^{5}y^{2}$.

$f\left( \left( x^{6}y, 0 \right)  \right) = \left( x^{7}, 0\right)$
$f\left( \left( x^{7}, 0 \right)  \right) = \left( x^{7}, 1\right)$

## why is this effective?
We have only used finite words for encoding.
