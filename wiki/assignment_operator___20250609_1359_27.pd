# assignment_operator
Assignment is an operator not a statement, it returns a value.
Assigment is right associative.
`i = j = k;` `:=` `i = (j = k);`

~~~{.c .numberLines}
int i;
i = 72.99f // (returns 72)
~~~

# compound assignment
As seen before, however we say that `v += e` is NOT equivalant to `v = v + e`. Pay attention to how many times v is called. For example

~~~{.c .numberLines}
a[i++] += 2;
// as opposed to
a[i++] = a[i++] + 2;
~~~

This is due to order of precedence, as well as [side_effects](side_effects___20240603_1300_44.pd).
They are also right associative, and can be chained. `i += j += k;` `:=` `i += (j += k);`
