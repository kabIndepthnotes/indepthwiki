# metric_function
## introduction
%%visits: 2
A function that maps a coordinate to a Real number, if the function has the 3 stated properties above
Thinking of it as a "distance function" helps the definition become more natural. 
## intuition
## rigour
metric function := let $X$ be a non-empty set, the function $d: X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ is called metric if: 
    $d(x,y) > 0$ if $x \neq y$ and $d(x,x) = 0$  non-negative
    $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$ symmetric
    $d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(x,z)$ Triangle inequality

In "A problemtext in advanced calculus" it states
between x and y should be: 
(i) greater than or equal to zero; 
(ii) greater than zero if x and y are distinct; 
(iii) the same as the distance between y and x; and 
(iv) no larger than the sum of the distances produced by taking a detour through a point z. 
We formalize these conditions to define a “metric” on a set.
