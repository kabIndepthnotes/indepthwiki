# normal_subgroup
## introduction
%%visits: 2
They have a sense of invariance, thinking of normal, or orthogonal, it helps to understand that they are not affected by some sort of changing_the_basis seen in [[similar_matrices]]

normal_subgroups are where right coset and left cosets are the same.

[[conjugation]] makes way for normal_subgroups, which make the left coset equal to the right coset

normal_subgroup:= When $H \subset G$ is a normal_subgroup if it is a subgroup and $\forall h \in H, g \in G ghg^{-1} \in H$:= The set of all conjugate elements are in the subgroup
## intuition

If $G_2 \triangleleft G_1$ then $G_1 / G_2$ forms a group


# The kernel of $\phi: G \to \text{Im} (\phi)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$

Proof: Let $K = \ker \phi \subset G$. We first show that $K = \ker(\phi)$ is a subgroup. Closure: let $k_1,k_2 \in K = \ker \phi$ then $k_1k_2 \in \ker \phi$ as $\phi(k_1k_2) = \phi(k_1) \phi(k_2) = e'e' = e$ therefore $k_1k_2 \in \ker \phi$. Associativity is inherited. Identity:\ $e \in ker \phi$ as $\phi (e) = e'$. Inverses For $k \in \ker \phi$ then $k^{-1} \in \ker \phi$ as $\phi (k^{-1}) = \phi(k)^{-1} = e'^{-1} = e'$ Therefore $k^{-1} \in \ker \phi$ so K is a subgroup.

We want to show that it is normal.Let $K=\ker \phi$

$\phi (g k g^{-1}) = \phi (g) \phi (k) \phi(g^{-1})$

$= \phi (g) e \phi(g^{-1})$

$= \phi (g g^{-1})$

$= e'$

Consequently by this theorem, [[simple_group]] only have trivial [[homomorphism]]s. 

Every normal_subgroup can be written as a kernel of a homomorphism

For every [[homomorphism]] there is a normal_subgroup. They are the same number.

[[special_linear_group]] $\triangleleft$ [[general_linear_group]]. PROOF, since the special_linear_group is the kernel of the determinant homomorphism $det:GL(n,\mathbb{C}) \to \mathbb{C}^{\times}$ then it is a normal_subgroup by the [[homomorphism_theorem]]

ormality of a subgroup allows us to have multiplication on [[coset]] space.
