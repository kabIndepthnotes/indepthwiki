#  dithering
dithering:= Overlaying a repeating pattern of disconnected pixels of one color over an image.

Dithering is used for creating artificial colors, adding texture, or tapering clusters into each other.

#  properties
The lighter color pops out more.
The recognising of the patterns is important, in a small space, dithering can seem like detail of the artwork or noise (which would be bad) instead of a fixed pattern.

#  uses
It makes new artificial colors
It allows tapering of clusters. Keep tapering clusters short as you don't want to make a new cluster.
