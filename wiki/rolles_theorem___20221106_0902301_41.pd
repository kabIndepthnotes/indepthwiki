# Rolle's Theorem

%%visits: 5
Let $f\in C[a,b]$ be differentiable on $(a,b)$ and assume $f(a) = f(b)$. Then there exists a point $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$

This is really just combining extreme_value_theorem with Fermats_Theorem. Can be proven case by case.

Rolle's thm

$f(a) = f(b)$

$f$ is cts on $\left[ a,b \right] $

differentiable on $(a,b)$

$\implies \exists c \in (a,b)$ so $f'(c) 0$


Link mean_value_theorem to rolles_theorem: Think of mean_value_theorem as a generalisation 

$$
f'(p) = \frac{f(b) -f(a)}{b-a}
$$ 

speed at some point is the same as the average speed.

If you travelled 60mph over an hour, at some point you travelled 60mph instantaneously

I model a stock $S(t) = Main(t) + Error(t)$. If I want to sell this stock, the error term needs to be low.

The behaviour of the stock over a year, modelled at every interval in a linear fashion. 

sps I culd partition $\left[ 0,1 \right] $ into small intervals. $I_1, \ldots , I_N$ so $sup |Error(t)| < 1p$

1. $S(t) = M(t) + e(t)$ Where the absolute value of $E(t)$ is never more athan 10 in the interval $\left[ 0,2 \right]$. suppose I want to subdivide $\left[ 0,2 \right]$ into $N$ intervals of even length so that the $max{|E(t) - E(s)| \le \frac{1}{1000}$ on each $I$. 
   
How big must I choose N?
