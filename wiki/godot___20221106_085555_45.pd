tiling
    - How do I make a tilemap to make tiling a lot easier?
        - You can add them all to scenes and then select all to convert to a tileset. Then use the tilemap node.

#  a game is a _ of _
A game is a tree of nodes, that group together in scenes.
They communicate using signals.

#  signals 
Nodes emit signals when some event occurs.
This feature allows you to make nodes communicate without hard-wiring them in code.

#  oop
- We do not have to strictly adhere to the oop philosophy
- We recommend dismissing architectural code patterns when making games with Godot, such as Model-View-Controller (MVC) or Entity-Relationship diagrams.
- A singleton is a globally accessible object

# gdscript
- is an imperative lang :~ tell computer how to do what it should do. non-example is regex, which tells it what to do.
- https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_languages.html#gdscript
- By convention, Godot's virtual functions, that is to say, built-in functions you can override to communicate with the engine, start with an underscore.

# pros
- Able to test a play separately to everything else.
