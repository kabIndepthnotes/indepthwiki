What is a homomorphic function of groups? $\phi (g *_G g') = \phi (g) *_H \phi(g') \:\forall g,g' \in G $
## intuition
Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be groups. A map $\Phi:G_1\to G_2$ is a _homomorphism_ if $\Phi(gh) = \Phi(g)(\Phi(h) \forall g,h, \in G_1$
It sat

## How a rubiks cube is a group
Every pattern is an element in a group, with actions, being the action of moving around with the cube.

## Examples pf $G_1 ~= G_2$== 

$G_1 = \left\{ -1 ,1\right\}$ under multiplication

$G_2 = \left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}   \right\}$

# Exam Clinic
Homomorphisms may need to be figured out on the spot, we need to think of the operation rule that defines the homomorphism

If the group is defined as a function, then proving homomorphism is simply using the function.

If the group is defined as a set of elements, then it won't be possible to use the function shortcut.

1. $\Phi: \mathbb{Z}_{N} \to {The n roots of unity under usual arithmetic multiplication)$

the order of an element is just shorthand for the order of the subgroup generated by an element.

extra Read or try to find.
Theorem, Two cyclic_groups of the same order are isomorphic.
The trivial homomorphism is 

$\phi : G \to H , \forall g,g' \in G \phi(gg') = e_H $

$\phi(g^2) = \phi(g)^2$

A function between two rings is homomorphic if

sum of inputs = sum of outputs

product of inputs = product of outputs

$1_R$ maps to $1_S$
## rigour
homomorphis `:=` A function between two groups is homomorphic if $\phi (g *_G g') = \phi (g) *_H \phi(g') \:\forall g,g' \in G $

## Theorems
A homomorphism is an [[isomorphism]] iff it is surjective and the kernel is trivial.

The kernel is a normal subgroup Theorem 10.2

The image of a homomorphism is an isomorphism


# The image of an homomorphism is a subgroup of $H$.

## Proof
Let $g_1' g_2' \in \text{Im}(phi) \subset  G_2$ Then there exists a $g_1,g_2 \in G_1$ such that $\phi(g_1) = g_1', \phi (g_2) = g_2'$ then $g_1' g_2' = \phi (g_1) \phi (g_2) = \phi (g_1g_2) \in \text{Im}(\phi)$ therefore $g_1' g_2' \in \text{Im}(\phi)$, hence we have closure

Associativity is inherited from the associative product of $G_2$

Identity since phi of e is e, we must have the identity.

Inverses: Due to surjectivity $\forall g' \in \text{Im} (\phi) \exists g in G_1$ such that $\phi (g) = g'$, now $g'^{-1} = \phi (g)^{-1} = \phi(g^{-1})$ therefore $g'^{-1} \in \text{Im}(\phi)$ 

Hence $\text{Im}(\phi) \subset G_2$ is a subgroup $\square$



*A homomorphism $\phi : G \to  \text{Im} (\phi)$ is an isomorphism $\iff$ the kernel is just the identity element.*

proof: By definition, $\phi$ is surjective. We only wts that it is injective and so ker is e and vice versa

"$\implies$"

$g \in \ker (\phi) \implies \phi (g) = e' \in \text{Im}(\phi)$ since $\phi$ is injective then $g$ is the unique pre-image of $e'$

"$\impliedby$"

Suppose for contradiction sake if $\phi (g_1) = \phi (g_{2})$ for $g_1 \neq g_2, g_1,g_2 \in G$ then $\phi(g_1) \phi(g_2)^{-1}= e'$ then this implies $\phi(g_1g_2^{-1}) = e'$ therefore $g_1g_2^{-1} \in ker(\phi) = \{e\} \implies g_1g_2^{-1} = e \implies g_1 = g_2$ which contradicts our assumption. $\square$


Theorem: Let $G$ be a group, then $G / Z(G) \cong Inn (G)$
Proof Consider he map $\psi : G \to Inn(G)$ given by $$
\psi (g) = \phi_g \text{ the inner automorphism, conjugation} $$ 
$\psi$ is a homomorphism:

$\psi(g_1g_2)(h) = \phi_{g_1g_2}(h)$ for some $g_1,g_2,h \in G$

$= (g_1g_2) h (g_1g_2)^{-1} = g_1g_2hg_2^{-1}g_1^{-1} = \phi_{g_1} \dot \phi_{g_2}(h)$

$= \psi(g_1)\psi(g_2)(h)$ therefore it is homomorphic

$im(\psi) = Inn(G)$ by construction (since it is a conjugation)

$ker (\psi) = \{g \in G | \psi(g) = \text{ identity map}\}$

$= \{ g \in G | \phi_g (h) = id(h) = h \forall  h \in G\}$

$= \{ g \in G | \phi_g (h) = hgh^{-1} = g \forall  h \in G\} = Z(G)$ 

Therefore by the group homomorphism theorem we have, $G \setminus Z(G) \cong Inn(G)$

Isomorphis `:=` Bijective homomorphism
Isomorphism:~ this shows the same underlying structure.

n.b. $\Phi^{-1}: G_2 \to G_1$ while $(\Phi(g))^{-1} \in G_1$ The first is a function inverse, the second is an inverse element.

Proof that $\Phi (e_1) = e_2$ (Identity maps to identity)
As $e_1 = e_1e_1$ then $\Phi(e_1) = \Phi(e_1e_1) = \Phi(e_1)\Phi(e_1)$
Now as $\Phi(e_1) \in G_2$, a group, then $(\Phi(e_1))^{-1}$ exists in $G_2$, hence when we left multiply the above by, this,
$e_2 = (\Phi(e_1))^{-1} \Phi(e_1)\Phi(e_1)= e_2 \Phi(e_1) = \Phi(e_1)$

Proof that $\Phi(g^{-1}) = (\Phi(g))^{-1}$
As $e_1=gg^{-1} \forall g \in G$ 
Therefore $\Phi(e_1) = \Phi(gg^{-1}) = \Phi(g)\Phi(g^{-1})$
But, $\Phi(e_1) = e_2$ 
So, $e_2=\Phi(g)\Phi(g^{-1})$
Left Multiply by $(\Phi(g))^{-1}$
$\Phi(g)^{-1} = \Phi(g^{-1})$
