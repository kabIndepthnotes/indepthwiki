- when you make an architectural elements, tiles are very important.
- They are all quads, but become hexagons etc to help.

problem, transitions fall on the edge of the game, and preparing a half cliff is awkward.
- poor solution:- make the cliffs too big or too small. You need to factor in neighbours in this grid.
- graph duality is the concept dual grid is based on. Every mathematical [graph](graph___20250311_0922_37.pd) has a symmetical graph.

- In the hexagonal dual grid, there are triangle grids and hexagonal grids. The hexagons are at the vertices of a triangle(s), and the vertices of the hexagon are at the edge (or face) of the triangles. The operation is the same for a dual grid.
