# strcpy
- what you intuitively do when you want to say

~~~{.c .numberLines}
str1 = "abcd"; /* wrong as str1 is an array name and cannot be on the left hand side*/
/* ~= */
strcpy(str1, "abcd");
~~~

- WARN: if the array of the destination is not big enough then undefined behaviour occurs. (see [strncpy](strncpy___20250710_0923_59.pd)
