#  turing_machine
This manipulates a strip of tape according to a table of rules.

- infinite memory tape divided into discrete cells
- each cell holds a symbol from a finite set of symbols (the alphabet)
- It has a head that reads the current cell
- dependant on the machines present state and the symbol read, the machine moves left or right, writes to the cell, or halts
- There is a finite table that instructs the machine to make a move (move left or right, write to the cell, or halt)
