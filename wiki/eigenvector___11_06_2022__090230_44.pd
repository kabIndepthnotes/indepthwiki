# eigenvector
## introduction
%%visits: 3
eigenvectors and [[eigenvalue]]s are used a lot in a lot of places. The idea of it is quite similar to [[determinant]]s, in the sense that it is about which vectors are scaled by the matrix. For an easy example, the vector $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0  \end{pmatrix}$ has eigenvectors $\hat{i}$ and $hat{k}$, as the vectors that it is scaling on is just them. a
## intuition
## rigour
What is an eigenvector? Transformation A has an eigenvector v if  $Av = \lambda  v$ where $\lambda$ is a scalar
