# pointer arithmetic
- there are 3 and only 3 pointer arithmetics

# adding an integer to a pointer

~~~{.c .numberLines}
int *p;
int j = 5;

int a[] = {/* populate */}

p = &a[2];
/* p + 3 will point to a[5] */

p += 4;
/* p points to a[6] */
~~~

# subtracting an integer to a pointer
This is similar to adding an integer.

~~~{.c .numberLines}
int *p;
int j = 5;

int a[] = {/* populate */}

p = &a[12];
/* p - 3 will point to a[9] */

p -= 4;
/* p points to a[8] */
~~~

# difference between 2 pointers
- this evaluates to the distance (in unit array element) between pointers.
- the $2$ pointers must be of the same array.

~~~{.c .numberLines}
p = &a[5];
q = &a[7];

i = q - p; /* evaluates to 2  */
i = p - q; /* evaluates to -2 */
~~~
