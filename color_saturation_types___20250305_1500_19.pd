# color_saturation_types


TODO
These are classifications of color based on saturation.
The effect of hue saturation and value are much different in certain ranges. e.g. hue doesn't matter at high or low brightness. Hue also doesn't matter as much at low saturation.

(Most saturated)
Intense := Very strong colors, hue plays a stronger role than value

Core := These are quite balanced, not the largest category of colors. Bright and vibrant but not too strong

Pastel := Hue is clear in this range. Hint of hue

Desaturated := Grey

Black

For any given hue, there are 4 different value categories and 4 different types of saturation.

V1, V2, V3, V4 := Dark, Mid-Dark,  Mid-Light, and Light respectively
S1, S2, S3, S4 := Intense, Core, Pastel and Tint respectively

The divisions are closer in warmer colors and further away in colder colours.
